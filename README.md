# Controller-For-an-Automatic-Washing-Machine
I developed a sophisticated Python project that functions as an intelligent controller for an automated washing machine. This innovative creation utilizes fuzzy logic to determine the optimal timing for washing clothes. The project initiates by collecting abundant data from sensors, including water dirtiness, fabric softness, and laundry quantity. Utilizing this data, I constructed a complex network of rules. The primary objective of the project was to estimate the ideal washing duration based on user inputs. To achieve this, I devised intricate rule sets that guide the project's decision-making process. For instance, if clothes are both dirty and not very soft, the project might recommend a longer wash cycle. Moreover, the project features a unique "indicator" that predicts how clean the clothes will become. Furthermore, I crafted another set of rules to calculate the appropriate amount of soap to use. When there's a considerable amount of laundry or if the clothes might not end up perfectly clean, the system dispenses more soap. Conversely, if there's a small load and the clothes are expected to be exceptionally clean, the system uses less soap. This project underscores my adeptness in Python programming, effective implementation of fuzzy logic, and the creation of intricate rule-based frameworks. It imbues the washing machine with a high degree of intelligence, enabling it to make informed decisions on the most efficient ways to launder clothes under varying circumstances.
